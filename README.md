# Overview
Conda Recipe Manager (CRM) is a library and tool-set capable of managing `conda` recipe files. It is intended
to be used by package builders and developers to automate the generation and editing of Conda recipe files.

The most mature portion of this project is the `parser` module, that allows developers to parse, render, and edit
existing recipe files. There is also some on-going work for parsing recipe selectors and Conda Build Config files.

For a more comprehensive break-down and status of the library modules, see
[this document](./conda_recipe_manager/README.md).

## Recipe Compatibility
The latest recipe-parsing compatibility statistics can be found in our the summary of our automated
[Integration Tests](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-recipe-manager/actions).

Our integration test data set is available [here](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-recipe-manager-test-data)
and is based off of publicly available recipe files from various sources.

NOTE: CRM only officially supports recipe files in the V0. There is on-going work to add full support for editing
V1-formatted files.

## History
This project started out as a recipe parsing library in Anaconda's
[percy](https://github.com/anaconda-distribution/percy) project. Some `git` history was lost during that transfer
process.

For those of you who come from `conda-forge`, you may associate CRM as "the tool that converts recipe files for
`rattler-build`". Admittedly, that was the first-use case of the parsing capabilities provided by in this library. In
the future, we aim to expand past that and offer a number of recipe automation tools and modules.

# Getting Started

## General Installation

To install the project to your current `conda` environment, run:
```sh
conda install -c conda-forge conda-recipe-manager
```
This will add the commands `conda-recipe-manager` and `crm` to your environment's path. Note that both of these
commands are the same. `crm` is provided for convenience of typing.

## CLI Usage
Although CRM is a library, it does ship with a handful of command line tools. Running `crm --help` will provide a
an up-to-date listing of all available tools. Run `crm <tool-name> --help` for usage documentation about each tool.

The following usage message was last updated on 2024-10-31:
```sh
Usage: crm [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Command line interface for conda recipe management commands.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  convert             Converts a `meta.yaml` formatted-recipe file to the new
                      `recipe.yaml` format.
  graph               Interactive CLI for examining recipe dependency graphs.
  patch               Modify recipe files with JSON patch blobs.
  rattler-bulk-build  Given a directory, performs a bulk rattler-build
                      operation. Assumes rattler-build is installed.
```

A high-level overview of the CLI tools can be found [here](./conda_recipe_manager/commands/README.md).

## Developer Installation and Notes
The `make dev` directive will configure a `conda` environment named `conda-recipe-manager` for you with
a development version of the tooling installed.

```sh
make dev
conda activate conda-recipe-manager
```

### Developer Documentation
We aim for a very high bar when it comes to code documentation so that we may leverage automatic documentation
workflows. API docs are hosted [here](https://conda-incubator.github.io/conda-recipe-manager/index.html)

### Setup Troubleshooting
- If you are currently in the `conda-recipe-manager` environment, make sure that you exit the environment with
  `conda deactivate` before running `make dev`. There have been known issues with attempting to delete the environment
  while an active instance is open.
- There have been known some issues using Berkley `make` (`bmake`) to setup the environment. The `Makefile` provided
  assumes GNU `make` is being used. This should only be an issue when running `make dev` as the `conda-recipe-manager`
  environment installs a version of GNU `make` to the environment.

### Making Commits
`pre-commit` is automatically installed and configured for you to run a number of automated checks on each commit. These
checks will also be strictly enforced by our automated GitHub workflows.

This project uses modern Python type annotations and a strict set of `pylint` and `mypy` configurations to ensure code
quality. We use the `black` text formatter to prevent arguments over code style. We attempt to signify if a type,
variable, function, etc is `private`/`protected` with a single leading `_`.

### Running pre-commit Checks Individually
The provided `Makefile` also provides a handful of convenience directives for running all or part of the `pre-commit`
checks:

1. `make test`: Runs all the unit tests
1. `make test-cov`: Reports the current test coverage percentage and indicates which lines are currently untested.
1. `make lint`: Runs our `pylint` configuration, based on Google's Python standards.
1. `make format`: Automatically formats code
1. `make analyze`: Runs the static analyzer, `mypy`.
1. `make pre-commit`: Runs all the `pre-commit` checks on every file.

### Release process
Here is a brief overview of our current release process:
1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
1. Update the version number in `pyproject.toml`, `docs/conf.py`, and `recipe/meta.yaml`
1. Ensure `environment.yaml` is up to date with the latest dependencies
1. Create a new release on GitHub with a version tag.
1. Manage the conda-forge feedstock, as per [this doc](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs/)

# Special Thanks
- @cbouss for his work on the [Percy project](https://github.com/anaconda/percy) that originally inspired the recipe parser.
- @akabanovs for his work and experimentation on package dependency graph building.
- @JeanChristopheMorinPerso for his PR review contributions when this project was a part of `Percy` and answering questions about the `conda` file formats.
