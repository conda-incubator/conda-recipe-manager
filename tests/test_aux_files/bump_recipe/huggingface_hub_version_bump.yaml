  summary: Client library to download and publish models, datasets and other repos on the huggingface.co hub
  description: |
    The huggingface_hub is a client library to interact with the Hugging Face Hub. The Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 35K models, 4K datasets, and 2K demos in which people can easily collaborate in their ML workflows. The Hub works as a central place where anyone can share, explore, discover, and experiment with open-source Machine Learning.

    With huggingface_hub, you can easily download and upload models, datasets, and Spaces. You can extract useful information from the Hub, and do much more. Some example use cases:

    - Downloading and caching files from a Hub repository.
    - Creating repositories and uploading an updated model every few epochs.
    - Extract metadata from all models that match certain criteria (e.g. models for text-classification).
    - List all files from a specific repository.
