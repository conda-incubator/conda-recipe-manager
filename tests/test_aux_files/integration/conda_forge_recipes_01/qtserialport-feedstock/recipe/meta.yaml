  description: |
    The QtSerialPort module is an add-on module for the Qt5 library, providing a single
    interface for both hardware and virtual serial ports. Serial interfaces, due to
    their simplicity and reliability, are still popular in some industries like the
    development of embedded systems, robotics, etc. Using the QtSerialPort module,
    developers can significantly reduce the time needed to implement Qt applications
    that require access to a serial interface.
