  summary: 'Easy (non)linear optimization in Python with symbolically-defined objectives/constraints'
  description: |
    symopt makes it easy to define and solve (non)linear constrained optimization problems in Python.
    It uses the power of SymPy to automate the error-prone and time-consuming task of writing
    functions to evaluate an optimization problem's objective function and nonlinear constraints
    (to say nothing of their first and second derivatives!). symopt then provides a standardized
    interface to solve the problem through nonlinear optimization backends including
    SciPy and Ipopt.
