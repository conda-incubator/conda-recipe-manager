  description: |
    Contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an implementation of the
    European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech transcoding, prI-
    ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse excitation/long term
    prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.  GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 162 13-bit
    samples (8 kHz sampling rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for
    compatibility with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames
    of 160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s). The quality
    of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker recognition; even music
    often survives transcoding in recognizable form (given the bandwidth
    limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).  The interfaces offered are a front end
    modelled after compress(1), and a library API.  Compression and decompression
    run faster than realtime on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been
    verified against the ETSI standard test patterns.
